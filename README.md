## Introduction
* An alliance is an agreement between a number of airlines to pool resources. An alliance is an agreement between a number of airlines to pool resources. Most airlines have enrolled in different alliances, and it gives them a greater ability to compete with airlines. Passengers can accumulate flying rewards when travelling within the same alliance. Airlines belong to three greatest airline alliance, Star Alliance, Skyteam, Oneworld, transported more than two-thirds of total scheduled traffic in the world. In this project we analysis the network of three airline alliances. We define airports as node and flights between airport 1 and airport 2 as edge in our network. We use degree centrality to measure each node in each alliance. We also perform community detection to compare the difference across three alliance. Combining the latest news that China Southern Airline, the largest air carrier, will leave Skyteam in January 2019 and might join Oneworld, we will discover the network and analyze the impact on Skyteam and Oneworld.
